## Module Description

NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor) allows you to remotely execute Nagios plugins on other Linux/Unix machines. This allows you to monitor remote machine metrics (disk usage, CPU load, etc.).
This puppet module manages the installation and configuration of NRPE.  It can install NRPE plugins and setup NRPE commands.  Secure communication to NRPE using SSL is also supported.

## Setup

The `nrpe` class installs the packages and configures the daemon.  By default, it will only configure the daemon to listen on localhost.
To allow connections from your nagios server, specify the `allowed_hosts` parameter when declaring the class.

```puppet
class { 'nrpe':
  allowed_hosts => ['127.0.0.1', 'nagios.example.org'],
}
```

## Usage

### nrpe

No NRPE commands are configured by default. To make the configuration useful, at a minimum, declare some [`nrpe::command`](#nrpecommand) resources.
To purge unmanaged NRPE commands:

```puppet
class { 'nrpe':
  allowed_hosts => ['127.0.0.1'],
  purge         => true,
  recurse       => true,
}
```

Full documentation for the `nrpe` class is available in the [reference](REFERENCE.md#nrpe) documentation.

### nrpe::command

This define can be used to add NRPE commands to the include directory for NRPE.

```puppet
nrpe::command { 'check_users':
  ensure  => present,
  command => 'check_users -w 5 -c 10',
}
```

It is also possible to use hiera data to create these resources by using the base class [`commands`](REFERENCE.md#commands) parameter.

```yaml
nrpe::commands:
  check_users:
    ensure: present
    command: 'check_users -w 5 -c 10'
```

Full documentation for the `nrpe::command` type is available in the [reference](REFERENCE.md#nrpecommand) documentation.

### nrpe::plugin

This define can be used to install NRPE plugins.

```puppet
nrpe::plugin { 'check_mem':
  ensure => present,
  source => 'puppet:///files/check_mem',
}
```

It is also possible to use hiera data to create these resources by using the base class [`plugins`](REFERENCE.md#plugins) parameter.

```yaml
nrpe::plugins:
  check_users:
    ensure: present
    source: 'puppet:///files/check_mem'
```

Full documentation for the `nrpe::plugin` type is available in the [reference](REFERENCE.md#nrpeplugin) documentation.
